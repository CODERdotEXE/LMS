# Library_Management_System (LMS) with SQL

A comprehensive project focused on building a robust Library Management System using SQL.

## Problem Statement

Design and implement a Library Management System (LMS) from the ground up, incorporating an Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram for a structured data model.

## Technical Approach

- **Database Design**: Crafted an ER-Diagram to accurately represent the library's data model, capturing relationships among entities such as books, members, loans, and staff.
- **SQL Implementation**: Translated the ER-Diagram into a fully normalized SQL schema. Developed SQL routines to manage core library operations, including book checkouts, returns, inventory management, and member tracking.
- **Optimization**: Employed indexing and query optimization techniques to enhance performance, ensuring efficient data retrieval and scalability.

## Outcome

Enhanced library operations by streamlining data management and improving decision-making processes. The system provides accurate, real-time insights into inventory, user activity, and operational efficiency.
